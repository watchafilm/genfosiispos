/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for SipSwift.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces public read access to drink menu data and open access to order data.
 * There are no user-based restrictions.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /drinks/{drinkId}: Stores drink menu items.
 * - /orders/{orderId}: Stores customer orders.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Drink menu data is publicly readable.
 * - All users can create, read, update, and delete order data.
 * - No user-based ownership or roles are enforced.
