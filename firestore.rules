/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the SipSwift application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset provides public read access to drink menu data and allows unauthenticated users to create order data. Updates and deletes of order data are disallowed.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /drinks/{drinkId}: Stores drink menu items.
 * - /orders/{orderId}: Stores customer orders.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Drink menu data is publicly readable.
 * - Order creation is open to allow unauthenticated orders, but updates and deletes are denied.
 * - No user-based ownership is enforced for orders, meaning all staff can view all orders.
 * - No write operation is authorized, so there's no denormalization needed.
