/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the SipSwift drink ordering application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * The ruleset provides open read access to drinks menu and open read/write access to orders,
 * allowing for real-time order management and data integrity. Write access to drinks is disallowed.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /drinks/{drinkId}: Stores drink menu items.
 * - /orders/{orderId}: Stores customer orders.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public read access to drink menu for ease of use.
 * - Open read/write access to orders for any user.
